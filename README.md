# FRC RoboRIO Web Dashboard Standalone Application

Allows for the FRC web dashboard on the National Instruments RoboRIO to be accessed from a PC with no browser that has HTML5 support. Should likely only be used in instances where a team only has their driver station laptop which is running Windows 7 or 8 and does not have any browser other than Internet Explorer installed.
